Exercise 1.4.1

When choosing the first element there are N possibilities.
When choosing the second element there are N - 1 possibilities. 
When choosing the third element there are N - 2 possibilities. 

So if the ordering matters, the result would be N * (N - 1) * (N -2). 

However in this case the ordering doesn't matter, and for each three elements combination there would be 3! orders, 3! = 6. 

Thus the final result is N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) / 6.
